Overview
------------
`youtube-sync-app` consists of a client and a server application, which makes it possible to synchronize youtube video playback between two computers. This means that when a user pauses or plays a video, it will do the same for other viewers as well. The frontend is built using React.  It uses WebSockets to communicate to the backend (Node.js).
